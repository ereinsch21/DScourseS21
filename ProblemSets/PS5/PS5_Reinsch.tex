\section{Web Scraping Data}
I scraped data from Wikipedia and looked at a list of ethnic groups in the United States by household income. The data shows that median household income is highest for Asian Americans ($87,243$ dollars). Next, White Americans have the second highest household income sitting at $65,902$ dollars. White Americans are followed by Native Hawaiians, "some other race", American Indian, and Black or African American respectively.
For my research project, I am interested in looking at the racial wage gap experienced between African Americans and other races, specifically the wage gap experienced by female African Americans. This preliminary research shows that, overall, African Americans earn less than other racial groups. This is evidence of discrimination.

\section{API Data}
I extracted an API from the FRED website. I used employment rate data spanning from 1990 to 2020. I observe many small fluctuations throughout the years. Nevertheless, the largest dip in the employment rate was 2020 which is certainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I used the "fredr" package in R-studio.
