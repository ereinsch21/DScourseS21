Betaols = 0.775. It is very close to the true value of beta = 0.7748.
My answers between the LBFGS OLS and Nelder-Mead optimization were identical at betahat=0.775
In this simple linear regression, betahat (X1)=0.775. For every one unit increase in beta1, Y increases by 0.775.
The true value of beta (betaTrue)=0.7748. Each optimization test I ran produced beta1 values of approximately 0.775 (Gradient Descent, LBFGS OLS, Nelder-Mead OLS, and LBFGS MLE).
