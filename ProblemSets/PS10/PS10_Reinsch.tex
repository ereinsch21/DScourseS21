We observe that each algorithm's out-of-sample performance yields results around the 0.84 mark. I was not able to generate the svm output since I was getting error messages in the console. The nnet algorithm yielded the lowest out-of-sample estimate (0.83) while the tree algorithm yielded the highest estimate (0.86). The logit and knn algorithms were both yielded out-of-sample estimates of 0.84
