I decided to take Data Science for Economists for many reasons. 
First, it is an excellent complement to Managerial Economics and Statistics for Decision Making as it provides students with more experience in programming languages. 
Since these programs are like learning new languages, the more practice I have with them, the better. 
Next, Economics is becoming a very data heavy field and understanding how to manipulate and explain data will be very important for the future. 
For the final project, I am thinking of looking at individual's wages pre-pandemic (2019) and "post" pandemic in Oklahoma, meaning the year 2020 to see how unemployment rates have affected income. 
After I graduate from this May with my master's and bachelor's degrees, I plan to either continue my Economics studies in the PhD program or pursue law school this fall.
