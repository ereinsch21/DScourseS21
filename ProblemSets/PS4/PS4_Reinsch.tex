\section{Data Sources}

I am interested in income data across gender and race. 
I am interested in college football sports statistics and I am interested in hashtag trends containing The Bachelor on Twitter.

Income data can easily be found through IPUMS-USA using American Community Survey Data. I believe sports statistics are available through the Sports Reference website (www.sports-reference.com) and tweets can be read in R studio by installing the read Twitter package and setting a specific location.
